            <h2 data-key="wiki-main-whatis-title">What is Time Mercenaries?</h2>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-whatis-p1">
                Time Mercenaries is a mod centered around the <strong>Dimensional Time Clock</strong>. This item allows you to communicate with and manage a team of unique mercenaries.
                <br>Your job is to send them on missions, and watch as they level up, becoming more powerful and unlocking new, more challenging (and rewarding) quests.
            </p>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-whatis-p2">
                This mod adds very few items and is mostly GUI based for now, it's main purpose is to give an alternate way of obtaining some Minecraft items.
            </p>
            <h2 data-key="wiki-main-features-title">Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li data-key="wiki-main-feature1"><strong>Mercenaries:</strong> 14 different Mercenaries with each their own missions and item pool.</li>
                <li data-key="wiki-main-feature2"><strong>Mission Rarity System:</strong> As you level up your mercenaries, they will unlock missions of new rarities which offer greater and new rewards.</li>
                <li data-key="wiki-main-feature3"><strong>Global Progression:</strong> Your progression is saved globally, this means that if you lose your Dimensional Time Clock, you can craft another one and get right back where you were.</li>
                <li data-key="wiki-main-feature4"><strong>Modular Upgrades:</strong> Enhance your Dimensional Time Clock with a wide array of modules, unlocking new mechanics, quality-of-life features, and even new mercenaries.</li>
                <li data-key="wiki-main-feature5"><strong>JEI/EMI Integration:</strong> Each item that can be obtained with a Mission will be shown in it's own GUI, you will see which Mercenary you need to recruit and the Mission Rarity needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-title">Getting Started</h2>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p1">
                Ready to recruit your first Mercenary? Your first step is to craft the <strong>Dimensional Time Clock</strong>. Once you have it, simply use the item (Right-Click, or use its keybind) to open the main interface and meet your first three potential recruits.
            </p>
            <img src="images/crafting.png" alt="Crafting" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p2">
                Once you first use the <strong>Dimensional Time Clock</strong>, you will be greeted with the Recruiting menu. On there you will see 3 randomly selected mercenaries ready to be recruited, but you will be able to choose one of them only.
            </p>
            <img src="images/recruit_screen.png" alt="RecruitScreen" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p3">
                You will then be able to choose between 3 Missions. Each of them will reward different items and will also require you to give some to start. The required items will be deleted from your inventory when you start the mission.
            </p>
            <img src="images/mission_screen.png" alt="MissionScreen" class="image"/>
            <img src="images/send_mission_portal.gif" alt="SendPortal" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p4">
                You will then have to wait for the mission to end to see if your Mercenary was successfull or not. At first, the time a mission take is hidden but the Common missions usually take only a few minutes.
                <br>Also you will be able to see your <strong>Dimensional Time Clock</strong> item texture update in real time !
                <br><strong>Important</strong> note ! The timer goes down only if you have the <strong>Dimensional Time Clock</strong> item on yourself !
            </p>

            <img src="images/waiting_gif.gif" alt="WaitingGif" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p5">
                When the timer is up, you can finish the Mission, on success a portal will spawn in front of you and the items will then be projected towards you on the ground. So be carefull where you complete your missions !
            </p>

            <img src="images/mission_success_gif.gif" alt="SuccessGif" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p6">
                Upon leveling up, your mercenaries "Trait" button will change color. This will indicate that you can level up one of it's trait to strengthen him for his future missions !
            </p>
            <img src="images/colored_trait_button.png" alt="TraitButton" class="image"/>
            <img src="images/trait_screen.png" alt="TraitScreen" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p7">
                There are also global upgrades that you can do with "Modules". You can hover over each one to see what they will unlock !
            </p>
            <img src="images/modules_screen.png" alt="ModulesScreen" class="image"/>
            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p8">
                Failed missions will sometimes inflict damage to your mercenary, and if they take too much damage they will die and will lose a level. You will be able to resurrect them by paying with some of your Experience Levels.
            </p>
            <img src="images/death_screen.png" alt="DeathScreen" class="image"/>

            <p data-key="wiki-main-gettingstarted-p9">
                Mercenaries have a Hunger mechanic. Each mission cost some Hunger to achieve, but even if a Mercenary is low on Hunger you will still be able to send him on a mission. When a mercenary is too hungry, he will take damage on missions. Hunger is refilling slowly over time and after each mission.
